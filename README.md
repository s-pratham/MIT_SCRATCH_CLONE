# Scratch Clone in React Native

A **Scratch** clone developed using **React Native** and **Expo**, designed to simulate the interactive coding environment found on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). This project brings similar features to mobile devices, allowing users to manipulate sprites, execute actions, and interact with an intuitive visual coding environment.

## Project Overview

This project is a mobile-friendly, React Native clone of **Scratch**, an open-source visual programming language and online community. The app enables users to create projects by combining sprites and actions, interacting with them visually, and executing actions. Designed for learning and creativity, itâ€™s a fun introduction to programming basics on a mobile platform.

## Features

- **Sprite Management**: Add, manipulate, and position sprites on a visual stage.
- **Actions**: Apply actions such as movement, rotation, and scaling to sprites.
- **Collision Detection**: Swap actions between sprites when they collide.
- **Gesture Control**: Move sprites on the stage using drag gestures.
- **Reset and Play Controls**: Reset all sprites to their initial state or play a sequence of actions.
- **Expandability**: Codebase is designed for easy extension to add more actions or sprite types.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scratch-clone.git
